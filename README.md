## Description
Go implementation of a simulation of thermal transmission in a 2D space.

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of a single-threaded implementation with a multithreaded one. Additionally, they can be compared with a single-threaded, multithreaded and distributed C implementation available in [this repo](https://github.com/mcanalesmayo/jacobi-mpi).

## Run and analyze benchmarks
By using the built-in tools we can easily run the benchmark and take a look at some hardware metrics to analyze the performance of the application. As prerequisite for visualizing the metrics, GraphViz must be installed.

To run the benchmark:
```
cd jacobi-go
# ForÂ CPU and memory profiles
go test -v -cpuprofile=cpuprof.out -memprofile=memprof.out -bench=. benchmark/benchmark_test.go
# For traces
go test -v -trace=trace.out -bench=. benchmark/benchmark_test.go
```

To visualize the cpu metrics (same thing works for memory metrics) in PNG format or via web browser:
```
go tool pprof -png cpuprof.out
go tool pprof -http=localhost:8080 cpuprof.out
```

For traces another built-in tool has to be used, which allows to visualize the metrics via web browser:
```
go tool trace -http=localhost:8080 trace.out
```
